'''As a player, I want to see the rules so that I can refresh my memory or learn how to play the game
As a Yahtzee player, I want to have five dice to play the game. 
As a player, I want to choose which dice to keep so I can keep my score, and be able to reroll only certain die, so I can be strategic in my turns.
I want the ability to roll any of the dice up to 3 times

After you \nfinish rolling, you must put a score in for one of the 13 categories. The game ends when all players have filled in their scorecard. \nTo decide who goes first, each player in turn rolls all 5 dice. the player with the highest combined score goes first, and the play passes \nto the left. The player with the highest total score wins! \nEnjoy!!")
